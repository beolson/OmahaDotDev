# Advent of Code Project Instructions

This is an Advent of Code challenge solution project built with React, TanStack Router, and Vite.

## Project Structure

- **src/challenges/**: Contains all challenge implementations and tests
- **src/routes/**: React Router routes for the web interface
- **src/components/**: React components
- **src/lib/**: Utility functions
- **design/**: UI mockup and design prototypes

## Code Quality (URGENT)

This project uses Biome for linting and formatting. Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards by running the lint and format commands before committing changes.

Unit tests are expected to be written for all challenge implementations using Vitest. Make sure to run tests to verify your code works as intended.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run by executing the command:
```bash
pnpm run test
```

This command should be executed from the `src` directory (not the project root).

## Running lint

Linting uses Biome, and can be ran with:
```bash 
pnpm run lint
```

This command should be executed from the `src` directory (not the project root).

## Formatting 

Biome is also used for code formatting, and can be ran with:
```bash 
pnpm run format
```

This command should be executed from the `src` directory (not the project root).
